### Red Flags (Things That Frustrate Players)
```
# BAD - Price way off market

poe.ninja says: 5 divine
# Player loses currency or can't sell

# BAD - Doesn't recognize value
"Vermillion Ring" with T1 life, T1 res, open prefix
Tool: "10c" (misses crafting potential)

# BAD - Wrong item category
Unique jewel priced as rare
# Completely wrong price

# BAD - Outdated league data
Using Standard prices in temp league
# Prices off by 10x+

3+ seconds to price check
# Faster to just check poe.ninja
