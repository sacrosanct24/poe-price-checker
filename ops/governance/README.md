# Governance

**Canonical governance source:** `devcenter-system/governance/ROLES.md`

This repository follows the Studio Governance Model.

**Canonical documents:**
- **Roles & authority:** `devcenter-system/governance/ROLES.md`
- **Operating process:** Defined in `devcenter-system/governance/ROLES.md` (Canonical Loop)

All agents operating in this repo are bound by those documents unless explicitly overridden by the Human Owner (Todd).

## Key Principles

- **No scope expansion:** Agents execute only declared tasks
- **No silent automation:** All operations must be explicit and auditable
- **No behavior drift:** If not declared in governance, it does not exist
- **Clean handoffs:** Mandatory report footer enforces role boundaries

## Role Summary

- **Todd:** Intent, merge authority
- **Scotty:** Governance framing, review, PR submission
- **Sulu:** Execution within boundaries
- **Riker:** Independent validation, drift detection

## Compliance

This repository is governed by the Canonical Loop defined in `devcenter-system/governance/ROLES.md`.

All paths in this document are **repo-local to poe-price-checker**.
