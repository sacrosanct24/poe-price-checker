# Path of Exile Rare Item Valuation Guide
**Purpose:** LLM Context Document for Understanding Rare Item Economy  
**Version:** 1.0 | **Last Updated:** 2025-11-24  
**Scope:** Path of Exile 1 (PoE2 has different systems)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Rare items in Path of Exile derive their value from a complex interplay of:
1. **Base type quality** - The item's foundation determines potential
2. **Affix combinations** - Specific modifier synergies for builds
3. **Meta relevance** - What builds are popular this league
4. **Crafting potential** - Room for improvement via bench/currency
5. **Scarcity** - How hard is this combination to obtain

Unlike unique items (fixed price lookups), rare items require **contextual evaluation** based on what builds need and what the market offers.

---

## PART 1: BASE TYPES AND ITEM FOUNDATIONS

### 1.1 Why Base Type Matters

The base type determines:
- **Implicit modifiers** (built-in bonuses)
- **Stat requirements** (Str/Dex/Int)
- **Base defenses** (Armour, Evasion, Energy Shield, Ward)
- **Affix pools** (what mods can roll)
- **Item level requirements** (for equipping)

---

## PART 2: AFFIX SYSTEM FUNDAMENTALS

### 2.1 Affix Basics

Every rare item can have:
- **Up to 3 prefixes**
- **Up to 3 suffixes**
- **1 implicit** (from base type)
- **Enchantments** (helmet, boots, certain bases)
- **Eldritch implicits** (if eldritch influenced)

### 2.2 Affix Tiers

Affixes roll in tiers (T1 being best):

```
Example: Flat Life on Body Armour
T1: +100-109 to maximum Life (ilvl 86+)
T2: +90-99 to maximum Life (ilvl 81+)
T3: +80-89 to maximum Life (ilvl 73+)
...
T7: +40-49 to maximum Life (ilvl 30+)
```

**General tier value assessment:**
- **T1-T2**: Premium value, crafting worthy
- **T3**: Good, usable for mid-tier gear
- **T4-T5**: Budget, leveling, or filler
- **T6+**: Vendor or reroll

### 2.3 Prefix Categories (Common)

| Category | Examples | Typical Builds |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Life** | +max life, % life | Nearly all life builds |
| **Energy Shield** | +max ES, % ES, hybrid | CI, LL, ES builds |
| **Defenses** | +armour, +evasion, % defences | Defence stackers |
| **Flat Damage** | Adds X-Y fire/cold/lightning/phys/chaos | Attack builds |
| **Spell Damage** | % spell damage, +gems | Casters |
| **Mana** | +max mana, % mana | MoM, Archmage |

### 2.4 Suffix Categories (Common)

| Category | Examples | Typical Builds |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Resistances** | +% fire/cold/lightning/chaos res | Universal need |
| **Attributes** | +str/dex/int, +all attributes | Attribute requirements |
| **Critical Strike** | Crit chance, crit multi | Crit builds |
| **Attack Speed** | % increased attack speed | Attack builds |
| **Cast Speed** | % increased cast speed | Casters |
| **Movement Speed** | % increased movement speed | Boots only, universal |
| **Accuracy** | +accuracy, % accuracy | Attack builds |

### 2.5 Hybrid/Special Affixes

Some affixes count as both prefix AND suffix or have special properties:

- **Hybrid life/defence** mods (count as one prefix)
- **Crafted mods** (benchcraft, limited power but fills gaps)
- **Fractured mods** (locked, always present, can't be changed)
- **Synthesised implicits** (special implicit pool, rare)

---

## PART 3: BUILD ARCHETYPES AND THEIR NEEDS

### 3.1 Life-Based Attack Builds

**Priority affixes:**
1. Maximum Life (+80 minimum, T1-T2 preferred)
2. Elemental Resistances (cap at 75% for each)
3. Flat damage (physical or elemental depending on build)
4. Attack speed
5. Critical strike (if crit build)
6. Accuracy (if not RT or accuracy solved)

**Example valuable helmet:**
```
+95 to maximum Life (T1)
+42% to Fire Resistance (T1)
+38% to Cold Resistance (T2)
+14% increased Attack Speed (crafted)
Nearby Enemies have -9% to Fire Resistance (influence)
```

### 3.2 Energy Shield / CI Builds

**Priority affixes:**
1. % increased Energy Shield (100%+ total)
2. Flat Energy Shield (+80 minimum)
3. Resistances (still need to cap)
4. Intelligence (scales ES)
5. Spell damage / crit for casters
6. Chaos resistance (less critical if CI)

**Example valuable body armour:**
```
Vaal Regalia (175 base ES)
+120 to maximum Energy Shield (T1)
+112% increased Energy Shield (T1)
+45% to Lightning Resistance
+40% to Cold Resistance  
+12% increased Intelligence (influence)
```

### 3.3 Spell Casters (Life or ES)

**Priority affixes:**
1. +1 to level of [element] spell gems
2. Spell damage / elemental damage
3. Cast speed
4. Critical strike chance/multiplier (if crit)
5. Life or ES (depending on build)
6. Mana (for Archmage/MoM)

**Example valuable wand:**
```
+1 to Level of All Fire Spell Skill Gems
+1 to Level of All Spell Skill Gems (influence)
75% increased Spell Damage
25% increased Cast Speed
+32% to Global Critical Strike Multiplier
Trigger a Socketed Spell when you Use a Skill (crafted)
```

### 3.4 Damage over Time Builds

**Priority affixes:**
1. +1 to gem levels (specific or all)
2. DoT multiplier (chaos, fire, cold, phys)
3. Damage over time / specific damage type
4. Life/ES (survival)
5. Resistances

**Example valuable amulet for RF:**
```
Marble Amulet (+1.6% life regen implicit)
+1 to Level of All Fire Skill Gems
+22% to Fire Damage over Time Multiplier (influence)
+75 to maximum Life
+12% to all Elemental Resistances
+45% to Fire Resistance
```

### 3.5 Summoner/Minion Builds

**Priority affixes:**
1. +1 to level of all minion skill gems
2. Minion damage / attack speed / life
3. Life/ES for survivability
4. Resistances
5. +1 to spectres (boots)

**Example valuable helmet:**
```
Bone Helmet (+2 minion gems implicit)
+3 to Level of Socketed Minion Gems (essence)
+90 to maximum Life
Minions deal 25% increased Damage
+40% to Cold Resistance
+35% to Lightning Resistance
```

### 3.6 Attribute Stackers

Some builds scale damage/defence from stacking one attribute.

**Strength stacker needs:**
- +str on every slot possible
- % increased attributes
- "Gain X per Y strength" mods

**Intelligence stacker needs:**
- +int on every slot
- % increased intelligence
- Hand of Wisdom and Action (unique), or rare wands with flat lightning per int

---

## PART 4: VALUE MULTIPLIERS

### 4.1 Mod Synergy (Most Important)

Items with **synergistic mods** are worth more than the sum of their parts:

**High synergy examples:**
- Life + triple resist (universal)
- ES% + flat ES + int (ES builds)
- Flat phys + attack speed + crit (phys attack)
- +gems + DoT multi + damage (DoT builds)
- Movement speed + life + triple resist (boots)

**Low synergy examples:**
- Life + ES (wasted, pick one archetype)
- Melee damage + spell damage (wasted)
- Fire damage + cold damage (unless omni/general ele)

### 4.2 Open Affixes

**Items with open prefix/suffix slots are more valuable** because:
- Crafting bench can add useful mods
- Exalt slams can add value
- Metamods allow further crafting

```
Example: 4-mod item with:
+95 life, +40% fire res, +38% cold res, 30% move speed
Open prefix = can craft flat ES, mana, or hybrid
Open suffix = can craft chaos res, attributes, or crit
```

### 4.3 Fractured Mods

Fractured items have one mod **permanently locked**:
- Cannot be removed by any currency
- Allows spamming fossils/essences safely
- T1 fractured life/ES = crafting base worth significant currency

### 4.4 Item Level Requirements

Higher ilvl = access to better mod tiers:
- **ilvl 84+**: Can roll all T1 mods
- **ilvl 86+**: Required for some influenced T1 mods
- **ilvl 83**: Good enough for most builds
- **ilvl 75-82**: Budget tier, missing top mods

### 4.5 Six-Link Premium

Six-linked body armours have **massive value premium**:
- 6L white base: 10-50c depending on league timing
- 6L rare: Add 50-200c+ to item value
- 6L corrupted: Varies wildly based on implicit

---

## PART 5: PRICING HEURISTICS

### 5.1 Quick Triage Questions

Ask these in order:

1. **Is the base type desirable?** (See Part 1)
   - No → Vendor unless exceptional mods
   
2. **Does it have life OR ES?** (Choose one)
   - Life < 70: Low value for life builds
   - ES < 60 flat or < 80% increased: Low value for ES builds
   
3. **How many resistances, and what tiers?**
   - Triple T2+ resist: Significant value
   - Single resist: Needs other strong mods
   
4. **Are there build-specific valuable mods?**
   - +gems, DoT multi, influence mods, etc.
   
5. **How many mods? Any open slots?**
   - 4-mod with good mods > 6-mod with filler

### 5.2 Price Anchoring

**General value tiers (highly league-dependent):**

| Category | Chaos Equivalent |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Vendor tier** | 0-1c |
| **Budget usable** | 2-10c |
| **Mid-tier** | 10-50c |
| **High-end** | 50-200c |
| **Premium** | 200c-5div |
| **Mirror tier** | 5+ div |

### 5.3 Red Flags (Value Destroyers)

- **Wrong defence type mix**: Life + ES hybrid (usually bad)
- **Conflicting damage types**: Phys + specific ele (unless conversion)
- **Low-tier defensive mods**: T5+ life/ES
- **Missing movement speed on boots**: Huge value loss
- **Corrupted with bad implicit**: Locks item, prevents crafting
- **Mana on non-mana builds**: Wasted affix
- **Thorns/reflect mods**: Always vendor

### 5.4 Green Flags (Value Boosters)

- **Triple T1 resist**: Always valuable
- **T1 life + good resists**: Universal demand
- **Open prefix/suffix**: Crafting potential
- **Desirable influence mods**: Build-specific premium
- **Fractured T1 mod**: Crafting base value
- **Eldritch implicits**: Free extra power
- **High movement speed on boots**: Universal want

---

## PART 6: META CONSIDERATIONS

### 6.1 League Start vs Late League

**League start (Week 1-2):**
- Basic gear with life + resist = valuable
- 5-links very valuable
- Low standards, high demand

**Mid league (Week 3-6):**
- Standards rise, need better rolls
- Build-specific mods gain value
- Generic gear loses value

**Late league (Week 7+):**
- Only top-tier items sell
- Crafting bases valuable
- Mid-tier = vendor

### 6.2 Current Meta Builds (Example - Will Vary)

**Always popular archetypes:**
- Righteous Fire (RF) - Needs life regen, fire DoT, max fire res
- Summoners - +minion gems, minion mods
- Bow builds - Crit, attack speed, flat damage
- Spell casters - +gem levels, cast speed, crit

**Check poe.ninja/builds for current meta** and note:
- What ascendancies are popular
- What unique items they use (rares fill gaps)
- What stats they need on each slot

### 6.3 Build Constraints Create Value

Builds have **non-negotiable requirements**:

**Attribute requirements**: If a build needs 200 dex for a gem, dex on gear becomes premium

**Resistance caps**: Must hit 75% each (135% uncapped with -60 base), chaos res increasingly important

**Accuracy cap**: Attack builds need ~100% hit chance, accuracy mods valuable if not solved

**Gem level breakpoints**: +1 or +2 gems can enable new gem levels with big damage jumps

## PART 7: PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### 7.1 Example: Evaluating a Ring

```
Steel Ring (Adds 3-14 Physical Damage implicit)
Item Level: 85
--------
+42 to maximum Life
Adds 8 to 16 Physical Damage to Attacks
+38% to Cold Resistance
+33% to Lightning Resistance
+14% increased Rarity of Items found
```

**Analysis:**
- Good base for phys attack (Steel Ring)
- Life: T4 (42), below premium threshold
- Flat phys prefix: T3, decent
- Double resist: T2/T3, good
- Rarity: Wasted suffix slot

**Verdict:** Budget-to-mid tier. The rarity mod hurts value significantly. A similar ring with a useful suffix (accuracy, attributes, crafted damage) would be worth 2-3x more.

**Estimated value:** 5-15c (league dependent)

### 7.2 Example: Evaluating Boots

```
Two-Toned Boots (Armour/Energy Shield)
+12% to Fire and Cold Resistances (implicit)
Item Level: 86
--------
+89 to maximum Life
+45% to Fire Resistance
+42% to Lightning Resistance
30% increased Movement Speed
```

**Analysis:**
- Excellent base (Two-Toned = free dual res)
- Life: T2 (89), very good
- Triple resistance total (implicit + 2 explicit)
- 30% MS: Standard, good
- 4 mods = open prefix + suffix for crafting

**Verdict:** High-end rare. The combination of life, triple res, MS, and open slots is exactly what most life builds want.

**Estimated value:** 50-150c+ depending on league

### 7.3 Example: Evaluating ES Helmet

```
Hubris Circlet
Energy Shield: 198 (augmented)
Item Level: 84
--------
+67 to maximum Energy Shield
89% increased Energy Shield  
+45% to Cold Resistance
+12 to Intelligence
```

**Analysis:**
- Best ES base (Hubris)
- Flat ES: T3 (67), okay
- % ES: T3 (89%), okay
- Total ES is good (198)
- Single resist
- Int is nice for ES scaling
- Missing a major mod (only 4 mods)

**Verdict:** Mid-tier. The ES is decent but not exceptional. Missing % res or another defensive layer. Open affixes allow crafting though.

**Estimated value:** 15-40c
